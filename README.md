# big-bye
A project that encompasses (almost) all the knowledge and skills I acquired throughout my undergraduate degree, serving as a farewell gift! 

The skills / tools I used
- Programming (C. Python, bash, etc)
- Server Setup (Web server with HTTPS by Caddy)
- Network Setup (Its currently hosted on my HomeLab)
- Soldering (Perfboard and SMD)
- PCB Desigining
- 3D Modelling (A case was supposed to be designed, didn't happen due to logistical issues)

## Components
- [Firmware](/firmware/)
- [Web Server](/web_server/)

You can find a demo of the project [here](https://youtu.be/nfPE4j3Xo48)!
